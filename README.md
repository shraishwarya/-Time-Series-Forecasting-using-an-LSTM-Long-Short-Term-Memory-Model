# Time Series Forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to perform time series forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks â€” a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. LSTMs are widely used for sequence prediction problems includes stock price prediction, weather forecasting, sales forecasting, and more.

The project covers the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Project Description

Time series forecasting involves predicting future values of a sequence based on its past observations. Traditional models like ARIMA may struggle with complex patterns or non-linear relationships. LSTMs can capture such dynamics effectively, thanks to their memory cell structure which helps retain information over long sequences.

This project uses an LSTM network implemented in Python with TensorFlow/Keras to forecast a given time series dataset.

## Dataset

* The repository includes a sample time series dataset (e.g., stock prices, temperature data, or any other sequential data).
* Data preprocessing includes normalization, windowing to create sequences, and splitting into training and testing sets.

*Note:* You can replace the sample dataset with your own time series data.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-lstm.git
cd time-series-lstm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* tensorflow (or keras)
* scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in a CSV format with a time-indexed column.
2. Modify the data loading script if necessary to fit your data structure.
3. Run the training script:

```bash
python train_lstm.py
```

4. Evaluate the model and visualize forecasts:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Model Architecture

* **Input Layer:** Sequence of past time steps
* **LSTM Layers:** One or more stacked LSTM layers with dropout for regularization
* **Dense Layer:** Output layer to predict the next time step value
* **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* **Optimizer:** Adam

The model is trained to minimize the forecasting error and learns temporal dependencies in the data.

---

## Results

* Includes plots showing training loss over epochs.
* Visual comparison of actual vs. predicted values on test data.
* Performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE to quantify accuracy.
